\begin{enumerate}
\item {\bf\color{blue} Q:}
      If the package installs successfully, but fails at initialization with
\begin{Error}
error: unable to load shared object
'/Users/your_username/Library/R/3.2/library/pbdZMQ/libs/pbdZMQ.so':

dlopen(/.../R/3.2/library/pbdZMQ/libs/pbdZMQ.so, 6):
Library not loaded: /.../src/zmq/lib/libzmq.4.dylib

Referenced from: /.../R/3.2/library/pbdZMQ/libs/pbdZMQ.so
\end{Error}
or
\begin{Error}
Library not loaded: /usr/lib/libzmq.4.dylib
\end{Error}
or
\begin{Error}
Library not loaded: /usr/lib/libzmq.so.4.0.0
\end{Error}
      {\bf\color{blue} A:}
      From the ZeroMQ installation messages:
\begin{Code}
If you ever happen to want to link against installed libraries
in a given directory, LIBDIR, you must either use libtool, and
specify the full pathname of the library, or use the `-LLIBDIR'
flag during linking and do at least one of the following:
   - add LIBDIR to the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH' environment variable
     during execution
   - add LIBDIR to the `LD_RUN_PATH' environment variable
     during linking
   - use the `-Wl,-rpath -Wl,LIBDIR' linker flag
   - have your system administrator add LIBDIR to `/etc/ld.so.conf'

See any operating system documentation about shared libraries for
more information, such as the ld(1) and ld.so(8) manual pages.
\end{Code}

    Further, for Mac OSX, the \code{otool} and \code{install_name_tool}
    commands are able to find and modify the linking path of \code{pbdZMQ.so}
    to the library \code{libzmq.4.dylib}. See the source of
    \code{pbdZMQ/src/install.libs.R} for how to change the linking path,
    accordingly.

\end{enumerate}
