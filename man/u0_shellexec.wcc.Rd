}

\item{file}{a file name as in \code{shell.exec}()}

\item{SW.cmd}{a SW_* command of showing windows}

\description{
This function is an extension to the \code{shell.exec}() which is a native
function of R
}
\details{
\code{shell.exec("a.txt")} will open a windows (notepad) to edit the file
\code{a.txt} in windows system. However, the notepad will block the (parent)
active R windows, i.e. \code{SW.cmd = 5} as \code{SH_SHOW} by default.

The \code{shellexec.wcc("a.txt", SW.cmd = 7L)} will open the notepad, but in
a minimized window. Therefore, there is no blocking to the active R windows.
See the website in the references section to see more options to control the
behavior of new windows. Possible choices are

\code{SW_SHOW (5)}: Activates the window and displays it in its current size
and position.

\code{SW_SHOWMINIMIZED (2)}: Activates the window and displays it as a
minimized window.

\code{SW_SHOWMINNOACTIVE (7)}: Displays the window as a minimized window.
The active window remains active.

\code{SW_SHOWNA (8)}: Displays the window in its current state.  The active
window remains active.
