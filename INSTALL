###
### pbdZMQ can be installed with/without external ZeroMQ 4.1.0 rc 1 library
### since pbdZMQ includes a minimum requirement of ZeroMQ 4.1.0 rc 1 library.
###
### pbdZMQ is also tested mainly on Linux (XUbuntu-14.04.1), Windows 7, and
### Mac OSX 10.7 systems. Solaris has no success yet.

--- 'pbdZMQ' Installation:
0. Download and extract 'pbdZMQ'

1. Default Installation without external ZeroMQ:
   This should work with most platforms.

     > R CMD INSTALL pbdZMQ_0.1-0.tar.gz

2. Installation with external ZeroMQ library such as version 4.1.2:

   - Minimum steps for installing ZeroMQ 4.1.2 library
     > ./configure \
          --prefix=/usr/local/zmq \
          --enable-shared=yes \
          --with-poller=select \
          --without-documentation \
          --without-libsodium
     > make -j 4; make install

   - Steps for pbdZMQ with the external ZeroMQ static library.

     > R CMD INSTALL pbdZMQ_0.1-0.tar.gz \
       --configure-vars="ZMQ_INCLUDE='-I/usr/local/zmq/include' \
                         ZMQ_LDFLAGS='-L/usr/local/zmq/lib -lzmq'"

   provided the external library is installed at "/usr/local/zmq" where
   "include/" subdirectory contains "zmq.h" and "lib/" subdirectory contains
   the shared library such as "libzmq.so".

--- Testing:
   Suppose 'pbdZMQ' is installed correctly. I can run the next from one
   terminal.

     > Rscript -e "demo(hwserver,'pbdZMQ',ask=F,echo=F)" &
     > Rscript -e "demo(hwclient,'pbdZMQ',ask=F,echo=F)"

--- Installation with different polling system:
    By default 'select' method is used in 'pbdZMQ' for Linux, Windows, and
    Mac OSX. However, users may want to use 'autodetect' or try others for
    better polling. Currently, the options as given by ZeroMQ may be 'kqueue',
    'epoll', 'devpoll', 'poll', or 'select' depending on libraries and system.

     > R CMD INSTALL pbdZMQ_0.1-0.tar.gz \
       --configure-vars="ZMQ_POLLER='autodetect'"
