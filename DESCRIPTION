Description: 'ZeroMQ' is a well-known library for high-performance
        asynchronous messaging in scalable, distributed applications.  This
        package provides high level R wrapper functions to easily utilize
        'ZeroMQ'. We mainly focus on interactive client/server programming 
        frameworks. For convenience, a minimal 'ZeroMQ' library (4.1.0 rc1)
        is shipped with 'pbdZMQ', which can be used if no system installation
        of 'ZeroMQ' is available.  A few wrapper functions compatible with
        'rzmq' are also provided.
SystemRequirements: Linux, Mac OSX, and Windows, or ZeroMQ library >=
        4.0.4.
